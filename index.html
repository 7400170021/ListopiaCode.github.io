<p>    “My husband does not go to work and his alcohol addiction has cost us all our savings and our children’s education”
    This was the story I heard from Vimala during my first exposure to the social sector in 2011 through an internship at Nirmaan. In spite of doing incredible work to improve education indicators, the leadership at Nirmaan found it very challenging to raise capital. As I struggled to identify ways to effectively fundraise, one of the observations was that the team at Nirmaan was not focused on organizational effectiveness to scale. As I continued to work with several other social entrepreneurs, I noticed this was a challenge for most organizations and hence they are largely unsuccessful in fundraising.</p>
     </p>

    <p>For social enterprises to reach scale effectively, it is important for them to receive financial and capacity building support at an early stage. Although there are several incubators and accelerators that have started providing support to startups in India, the social enterprises are left behind in the startup ecosystem. Most of the impact funds in India don’t cater to early stage enterprises as the economics of deal does not work for lower investment sizes. Moreover, due to lack of focus on scale, the impact funds are forced to look at mainstream companies to generate adequate financial returns.
    </p>
    In addition, there is a need for patient capital from passionate individual investors who are able to understand the long-term benefits of creating sustainable change in the social sector. These investors with sector expertise need to work closely with the entrepreneur to effectively use the capital invested to scale significantly, in-turn allowing the investor to have an exit option from the investment in about 5-7 years. These individual investors will also be instrumental in getting an impact fund to invest in the social business in order to take the operations to the next level. </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, there has to be a behavior shift in social entrepreneurs to bring organizational effectiveness to their business. By investing in increasing the capacity of the team to learn and implement best management practices, the social entrepreneurs can eventually compete with for-profit companies for capital. Following the right management practices will help the social entrepreneurs to overcome challenges of growth and build the right set of partnerships with key stakeholders to increase the financial and social returns through their work.</p>

    <p> In order to fix the chicken – egg problem in impact investing, it is essential to invest in social enterprises at an earlier stage. The early stage enterprises need adequate financial and capacity building support to refine the business model to be able to easily expand to geographies or venture across the value chain. This support can be provided by incubators and accelerators focused on social enterprises to make them investor ready and connect them with the right set of mentors to improve the business model.
    How innovative investment models can help
    To realize the full potential of impact investing, there is need for innovative investment models such as investment platforms that can reduce information asymmetry between investors and social enterprises by providing the necessary features for communication and information sharing of investment material.  Furthermore, through technology and templated investment material, investment platforms can reduce cost and time taken for a transaction. In addition, investors need to work hands-on with social entrepreneurs to help them refine their business plan for short term and prepare investment material. These platforms can provide opportunity for people with smaller investment appetite who typically focus on public markets.
    I hope that technology will continue to be a driving factor for more capital to be invested in the development sector and achieve the necessary social outcomes. Till such time, impact investors will continue investing in food delivery businesses or other mainstream businesses while several others like Vimala wait to be rescued by a social enterprise that can’t reach scale.</p>
